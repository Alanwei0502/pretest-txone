Please create React codes compatible with Chrome and Firefox.

You need to use React.js (v18 above) with react hooks to handle API and error handling to complete the following tasks.
For styling, either use style component or TailwindCSS (preferred).

If you are unsure about the question, feel free to make all the necessary UI behavior assumptions and state them in a separate document.

## Your deliverables are:
- React project files containing the answers to the questions
- Any additional files (images, JavaScript, CSS) that accompany the HTML files - (optional) a separate MS Word or txt file containing your assumptions

## Your answer will be evaluated based on:
- Feature completeness
- Code readability (naming convention, comments, etc) - Web Standards compliance
- Code reusability and extendibility
- Compatible with different display resolution of clients

## Extra points: (Nice to have, not necessary)
- Unit test
- Responsive web design
- A readme file to describe the project
- Any features to make this project more creative.
